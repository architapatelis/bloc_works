How does our simple routing differ from Rails routing? What are we missing?

Ans. Our simple routing only allows for GET actions to be done on a Bloc Works applicationâ€“the user can retrieve web pages and get some error messages,.

With Rails we were able to perform CRUD operations with the database, which is what we are missing with simple routing. Also, in Rails, a resourceful route (:resources) provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and URLs to controller actions. By convention, each action also maps to a specific CRUD operation in a database.
